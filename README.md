# CCR v2.4su
Board/schematic/gerber files for the CCR project - v2.4su variant

This variant is the latest (as of 4/4/20) cost optimized version, which supports regen automatically, with use of external buffer pack (clamp circuit limits voltage at input of tester to 12.5V). All specs are the same as v2.4 otherwise (6A charge/discharge symmetric, thermally limited to 21W max without buffer pack).
